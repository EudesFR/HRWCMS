<h3>Quote from the directory owner :</h3>
<blockquote><i>Quackster, you think you're smarter than everyone else when someone asks you to share your sources, you want to keep everything to yourself like a poor bastard, so just for that, I decided to create a complete v26 pack, 100% French style, so that you understand that you have to know how to share and not repack people who ask you for help, fuck you!</i></blockquote>
