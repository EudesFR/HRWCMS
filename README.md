<h3>Special quote from the directory owner :</h3>
  
 <blockquote><justify><i><a href="http://forum.ragezone.com/members/861739.html"><b>Quackster</b></a>, you think you're smarter than everyone else when someone asks you for help, you want to keep everything to yourself like a poor bugger, so just for that, I decided to create a complete v26 pack, 100% French style, so that you understand that you have to share in life, that <a href="https://classichabbo.com/"><b>ClassicHabbo</b></a> is far from being exclusive (let's face it) and that you shouldn't fail people who ask you for help. Fuck you dude, from someone who knows how to share when they see people in need!</i></justify></blockquote>

<h3>Installation Guide</h3>
<li>Download the entire pack of this directory</li>
<li>Start by transferring the contents of the "CMS" folder to your website</li>
<li>To do things properly, I strongly advise to dissociate the DCR's from the CMS by creating a sub-domain specially designed to contain the DCR's (but you can, if you want, create a "v26" folder at the root of your website and transfer the DCR's there)</li>
<li>Once the DCR's have been transferred, you will have to go to the root folder, and modify the file "<b>vars.txt</b>", by replacing "<b>http://####SITE####/v26/</b>" by the link of your DCR's</li>
