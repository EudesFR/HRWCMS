<h3>Special quote from the directory owner :</h3>
  
 <blockquote><justify><i><a href="http://forum.ragezone.com/members/861739.html"><b>Quackster</b></a>, you think you're smarter than everyone else when someone asks you for help, you want to keep everything to yourself like a poor bugger, so just for that, I decided to create a complete v26 pack, 100% French style, so that you understand that you have to share in life, that <a href="https://classichabbo.com/"><b>ClassicHabbo</b></a> is far from being exclusive (let's face it) and that you shouldn't fail people who ask you for help. Fuck you dude, from someone who knows how to share when they see people in need!</i></justify></blockquote>

<h3>CMS Installation Guide</h3>
<li>Download the entire pack of this directory</li>
<li>Start by transferring the contents of the "CMS" folder to your website</li>
<li>To do things properly, I strongly advise to dissociate the DCR's from the CMS by creating a sub-domain specially designed to contain the DCR's (but you can, if you want, create a "v26" folder at the root of your website and transfer the DCR's there)</li>
<li>Once the DCR's have been transferred, you will have to go to the root folder, and modify the file "<b>vars.txt</b>", by replacing "<b>http://####SITE####/v26/</b>" by the link of your DCR's</li>
<li>It will then be necessary to import the "<b>holosql.sql</b>" database into your database</li>
<li>Once the CMS, DCR's and SQL have been imported, you'll need to go to "http://<b>YOURSITE</b>/install".</li>
<li>You will then have to follow the installation system and insert the required values</li>
<li>Once the installation process is complete, you will need to remove the files "<b>install.php</b>" and "<b>upgrade.php</b>" from your website</li>
<li>Well done, your CMS is connected to your DB and is ready to be configured to work</li>

<h3>EMU Installation Guide</h3>
<li>It is strongly recommended to use a <b><a href="https://alls-heberg.fr/windows">VPS Windows 2012 R2 Standard</a></b> or earlier for proper operation.</li>
<li>Once connected to your VPS, you will need to disable all firewalls</li>
<li>In the emulator folder you will find 2 softwares to install before launching the emulator</li>
<li>Once the software is up and running, you'll need to configure the emulator in the "<b>bin\Debug\bin\mysql.ini</b>" file.</li>
<li>Finally, you'll have to run the "bin\Debug\Holograph Emulator" software</li>
<li>Cool, your emulator is up and running and ready to receive users</li>

<li>Once you have configured everything, you will need to go to "<b>http:/YOURSITE/housekeeping/index.php?p=server</b>"</li>
<li>Here you will need to fill in the information of your VPS</li>
