<h3>Special quote from the directory owner :</h3>
  
 <blockquote><justify><i><a href="http://forum.ragezone.com/members/861739.html"><b>Quackster</b></a>, you think you're smarter than everyone else when someone asks you for help, you want to keep everything to yourself like a poor bugger, so just for that, I decided to create a complete v26 pack, 100% French style, so that you understand that you have to share in life, that <a href="https://classichabbo.com/"><b>ClassicHabbo</b></a> is far from being exclusive (let's face it) and that you shouldn't fail people who ask you for help. Fuck you dude, from someone who knows how to share when they see people in need!</i></justify></blockquote>
